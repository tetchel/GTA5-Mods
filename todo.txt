Bugs:
You still get a wanted level briefly if you do something bad in front of police - seems to be fixed
unmarked peds will not count as kills if the player is too fast. probably too much work to fix this
Slowing down time (by changing weapons, using power) doesn't slow down clock

There are always more bugs

Features:
Armor, accuracy
More variety of enemies (one type per level!)
Points display other than subtitle
Prioritize player's Z position when finding enemy spawn location so that they don't spawn on over/under passes / on top of parking garages / etc
other cool stuff (speed? first person? GET_TIME_SINCE_PLAYER_DROVE_AGAINST_TRAFFIC)
Cops and peasants (others?) run away from you
Spawn enemies facing player

Could:
Discourage running away more (but how)
Initialize all enemies when round starts to improve performance (would it though?)
Enemies in cars in later levels??
Reward for killing (world's) enemies in cars??
Getting on bikes pimps them out??
