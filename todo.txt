Bugs:
You still get a wanted level briefly if you do something bad in front of police
There are always more bugs

Features:
Armor, accuracy
More variety of enemies (one type per level!)
Points display other than subtitle
Prioritize player's Z position when finding enemy spawn location so that they don't spawn on over/under passes / on top of parking garages / etc
Bonus points for headshots (probably not possible), other cool stuff (speed? first person?)
Cops and peasants (others?) run away from you
Spawn enemies facing player

Could:
Make being off bike harsher / think of a more fun way to punish (less points for kills?)
Discourage running away more (but how)
Mark peasant if you aim at them
Initialize all enemies when round starts to improve performance (would it though?)
Enemies in cars in later levels??
Reward for killing enemies in cars??
